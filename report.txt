Problem Statement
==============================
In this project we are implementing a bash shell using c.  We are essentially
trying to get the output of this program to be as similar as possible to bash
with all the neat features like piping and the required built-ins.

Steps Taken To Solve Problem
==============================
1) Experimented with bash on the linprog server.
2) Took notes on output for required built ins, piping , I/O, etc.
3) Implemented User Input / Parsing to get commands/arguments
4) Implemented Built-Ins
5) Implemented Input Redirection
6) Implemented Environment Variables
